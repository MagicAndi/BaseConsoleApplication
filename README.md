BaseConsoleApplication
======================

A base console .NET application built with C# and Visual Studio 2013, to be used as a template for POC and production console applications.

This was inspired by <a href="https://github.com/TypecastException/ConsoleApplicationBase">https://github.com/TypecastException/ConsoleApplicationBase</a> project (see the blog post <a href="http://typecastexception.com/post/2014/09/07/C-Building-a-Useful-Extensible-NET-Console-Application-Template-for-Development-and-Testing.aspx">http://typecastexception.com/post/2014/09/07/C-Building-a-Useful-Extensible-NET-Console-Application-Template-for-Development-and-Testing.aspx</a>).  However, few of my console applications require an interactive console, so I thought I would create a simpler version.

## Packages
This base console application makes use of the following nuget packages:
* NLog
* BizArk.Core
*
